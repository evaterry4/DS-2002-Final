My final project with outputted results is given by bzt4em_final_project.ipynb. 
I have included the data files for the purposes of recreation in the file structure that I used. the final_data folder was stored in FileStore on the DBFS. The dump_classic_dw.sql was run to create the classic dataware house from my midterm which originated from data populated by classicmodels as specified in mysqlsampledatabase.sql in the class GitHub.
