My final project with outputted results is given by bzt4em_final_project.ipynb. 
I have included the data files for the purposes of reproduction in the file structure that I used. the final_data folder was stored in FileStore on the DBFS. The dump_classic_dw.sql was run to create the classic dataware house from my midterm which originated from data populated by classicmodels as specified in mysqlsampledatabase.sql from the class GitHub (this file is also included in this repository).
